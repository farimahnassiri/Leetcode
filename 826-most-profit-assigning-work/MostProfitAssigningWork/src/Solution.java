/*
 * You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:
 * difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
 * worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).
 * Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.
 * For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. 
 * If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
 * Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
 * Output: 100
 * Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
 * Output: 0
 * Constraints:
 * n == difficulty.length
 * n == profit.length
 * m == worker.length
 * 1 <= n, m <= 10^4
 * 1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5
